**What is it?**

Copper bars.

**What for?**

Your website.

**What's that look like?**

[Like so](http://halcy.de/coppers/coppersfull.htm), text optional.

**Great, how?**

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="coppers.css">
    [...]
    <div coppers="yes"></div>

**Does that work on body?**

Yes.

**How exactly...**

You don't want to know.

**What browsers?**

Any that have good SVG support, which means firefox only.

**Why?**

Technology has come far, so we can have 1980s Amiga effects on the web now.

**Those aren't real copperbars!**

There probably is a number of coprocessors involved somehow.

**The lines between colour transitions are ugly!**

I can make them go away but that makes the SVG renderer choke.

**Anything else?**

CSS and SVG are terrible and the web needs to die.
